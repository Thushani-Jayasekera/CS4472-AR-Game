# CS4472-AR-Game

## Introduction
Unafraid is a Mobile AR Game developed to enable a fun gaming experience for users and to help people overcome phobias related to animals, such as “arachnophobia” - fear of spiders. The game is for a single player, and the player can choose from 3 game modes. The three game modes are;
1. Shooter - The player can first select a level ( Easy / Medium/ Hard), and then the system shall spawn AR spiders for the users to shoot and kill. For every kill, the score will be updated in real-time.
2. Creature interaction - The player can drag and place an AR spider on the screen, resize it, and rotate it.
3. Creature-on-hand - The player can place a red circle on his/her hand, and the system shall map an AR spider to the red circle, giving the player the feeling of a spider on hand.
These game modes will enable users to play and get familiar with the animals to overcome their phobias.
